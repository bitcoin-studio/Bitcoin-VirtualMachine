# Machine image builder focused on Bitcoin

**Quick Start**: _Install Vagrant and Virtualbox. Then open a CLI terminal, and run `vagrant init bitcoin-studio/Bitcoin-VirtualMachine; vagrant up; vagrant ssh`. You're now in an environment with lnd and other Bitcoin tools. If that doesn't work, read further on in this guide for more details._

## Summary

This tool is made of three technologies, Packer, Vagrant and Ansible, allowing us to generate an Ubuntu 18.10 VirtualBox 
image (and Vagrant box) packaged with softwares for Bitcoin / Lightning Network. You can find Bitcoin Core, LND, c-lightning, 
Electrum, a BitcoinJS guide, etc. <br/>
The image is ideal for Bitcoin workshops, hackathons, etc.


## What is inside

The VirtualBox image itself is not included in this repository, you need to generate it yourself with the `packer build` command, see below.
It usually takes between 30 minutes and 2 hours, depending on your internet connection and the speed of the Ubuntu mirror server.

### Operating System

Ubuntu 18.10 Cosmic - desktop version.
The [preseed.cfg](packer/http/ubuntu-desktop/preseed.cfg) file is used to do an automatic install.

### Softwares

- Bitcoin Core (latest) from the [Bitcoin PPA](https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/ubuntu/bitcoin) 
  - Using the bitcoin.conf from the BitcoinJS guide
  - Set by default on Regtest mode

- Lightning Network  
  - LND
  - c-lightning  
  
- Wallets
  - Electrum  

- Terminal
  - ZSH (Antigen)
  - Tilix
    
- Code editors
  - Brackets
  - Vim

- Programming languages, compilers, ...
  - C
  - Node.js (v10)
  - Go (v1.11.5)  

- Various libraries
  - Libbitcoin-explorer (bx)
  - JQ


You can deactivate installation of what you don't want by removing roles in the main [playbook](ansible/playbook.yml).


### BitcoinJS guide

Included right on the desktop is the extensive [BitcoinJS guide](https://github.com/bitcoin-studio/Bitcoin-Programming-with-BitcoinJS)
made by StÃ©phane Roche from Bitcoin-Studio. You can explore it to learn how to do all kinds of Bitcoin transaction.


## How to import and launch the VM

There are two ways to launch the VM, from VirtualBox or from Vagrant.

### Using VirtualBox

After a build you will find two files in the `packer/outputs` directory, a .ovf and a .vmdk.  
To import the image into VirtualBox you can double-click on the `.ovf` file or select it from the VirtualBox import panel.

You have to uncheck "Import hard drives as VDI", otherwise you get a `NS_ERROR_INVALID_ARG (0x80070057)` error.

After importation you can select it and click start.

### Using Vagrant

With Vagrant, you have to add the Vagrant box to Vagrant and run it. See the Vagrant section below.


## How to login

There is only one user, username: `bitcoin`, password: `bitcoin`. 
It has sudo access without password!
There is no `root` user.
When you launch the VM it has auto-login feature activated.

If you want to connect in command-line from the host machine, you can do it with `vagrant ssh`, see below.


## How to generate a VM image 

We use Packer to create the VirtualBox virtual image and a vagrant box.
Ansible is used to provision the virtual image.

### Packer
> You will need to remove the `vagrant-cloud` post-processor from [packer/ubuntu-desktop.json](packer/ubuntu-desktop.json)
> to avoid Vagrant Cloud authentication error. 

Avoid Ansible failing with `Failed to connect to the host via ssh`
```
$ export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
```

Generate the virtualbox image and the vagrant box
```
$ cd packer
$ PACKER_LOG=1 PACKER_LOG_PATH=packer.log NAME=bitcoin-virtual-machine UBUNTU_CODENAME=cosmic packer build -force -on-error=ask ubuntu-desktop.json
```

Keep an eye on the log
```
$ tail -f packer.log
```

#### Setting a Ubuntu mirror server

If the OS installation is too slow you can set an other Ubuntu mirror in the 
[preseed.cfg](packer/http/ubuntu-desktop/preseed.cfg) file, choosing one close to your location.
> Line: d-i mirror/http/hostname string MIRROR

### Vagrant

In order to run our box we can `add` the one created by packer.
Or if you don't add the box, `vagrant init` will simply import the one hosted on [Vagrant Cloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/bitcoin-studio/boxes/Bitcoin-VirtualMachine).

Add the box to Vagrant
```
$ vagrant box add --name bitcoin-studio/Bitcoin-VirtualMachine packer/outputs/bitcoin-virtual-machine.box
```

Launch the VM
> We need to cd into `./vagrant` because the ssh keys are there, and to have everything Vagrant related in this directory
```
$ cd vagrant
$ vagrant init bitcoin-studio/Bitcoin-VirtualMachine
$ vagrant up
```

Run the Ansible provisioning against the vagrant box
```
$ vagrant provision bitcoin-studio/Bitcoin-VirtualMachine
```

Print the Vagrantfile included in the box
```
$ tar -O -xf packer/outputs/bitcoin-virtual-machine.box Vagrantfile
```

#### SSH connection to VM via vagrant

Generate a new ssh key pair
> I place them into `./vagrant` directory, named `vagrant-rsa` and `vagrant-rsa.pub`
```
$ cd vagrant
$ ssh-keygen
> Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/steph/.ssh/id_rsa): vagrant-rsa
```

The script [vagrant.sh](packer/scripts/linux-common/vagrant.sh) is used by Ansible to copy the ssh public key to the VM. 
The key is hardcoded there, if you generate a new key pair you have to replace the public key in the script.

If you prefer to copy the ssh public key to the VM manually instead of using the script
```
$ cd vagrant
$ cat vagrant-rsa.pub | ssh bitcoin@127.0.0.1 -p 2222 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod -R go= ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Establish a SSH connection
> If the SSH keys are ok you should not be asked for a password
```
$ vagrant ssh
```

#### Shared folder

Vagrant allows you to have a shared folder between your host machine (at `vagrant/shared`) and the guest VM 
(at `/home/bitcoin/Desktop`).

You need to install vagrant-vbguest
```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

### Ansible

Create a new role with all the boilerplate
```
$ ansible-galaxy init ROLE
```

Check playbooks syntax
> It is useful to execute it before running a packer build
```
$ cd ansible
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml --syntax-check
```


## Troubleshooting

#### The font is too small
You can increase the scale factor in Virtual Box and/or in Gnome-Tweak-Tool present on the desktop.

#### The display is buggy after a resize
Changing the "resize" and "scale" from `View > Virtual Screen 1` VirtualBox menu should fix it.
